# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind + PrimeVue Template

This is a **Vue 3** frontend template built with **TypeScript** and **Vite**, styled using **Tailwind CSS v3.4**. It uses **PrimeVue** as the component library along with **PrimeIcons** for icons. State management is handled with **Pinia**, and styles are extended with **Sass**. It includes basic **login** and **register** pages, as well as a basic application layout to help you get started quickly.

## Theme Customization

To modify the default theme, edit the file:

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
(Be sure to disable Vetur for best TypeScript + Vue support.)

## Type Support for `.vue` in TypeScript

TypeScript doesn't natively support `.vue` imports. This project uses `vue-tsc` for full type checking support.
Make sure you're using **Volar** in your editor.
